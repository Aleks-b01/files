Intro:
- on my mind for over 1.5y
- 1st att 6 months ago and failed
- picked up again ltl over month ago
- finished week ago
- hope to prevent some mistakes and assist
- last thing I want is for someone to quit

Oz:
- Corners only worth learning if you don't understand comms yet
- example UFR UBR RDF
- example UFR UBR FDR
- Edges only worth learning if fingertricks will be bad cuz you understand comms now
- Corners over edges

When to learn 3s:
- no straight sub x answer yet
- learn whenever you're ready and feel ready
- that means you understand comms, understand the goal (will be covered in a bit) have some free time (really don't need much) and dedication
- sub 2 is recommended by ppl and me, you should start considering at sub 2, doesn't mean don't learn before sub 2

Goal/approach:
- very important
- you might say 3s is 800 algs
- 3s is not 800 algs
- 3s is 800 comms give or take for algs
- what that means for you is that you shouldn't drill them into mm instead you should understand the comms/setups
- example UF FR LB
- comm in theory is R setup to UF UB LB
- you don't have to learn it like that, you can think of it as something different, like R2 setup to UF BR LB
- you might be overwhelmed, I'm not saying this as "you should learn every way to think of the comm"
- instead I'm showing you that you have variety when learning 3s
- there is no right or wrong way of understanding a comm
- what matters is that your brain understands it, that's whats gonna make you be able to recall the comm and learn 3s

Starting to learn:
- start by doing edge and corner only solves and figure out intuitive comms
- they don't have to and are not supposed to be the best

Choosing the comms:
- recommend elis sheet
- I made my own with blddb
- would only recommend if you're really determined and ready to refine comms a lot

Approach:
- learn set by set/letter by letter
- either learn from the sheet directly or with anki
- what you're trying to do is figure out the comm first before looking at the answer
- after learning a set, drill comms with sighted solves
- can take as little as 15 mins a day
- if you come across an alg you can either try learn it or leave it for later and come up with an intuitive alg
- review comms

After 3s:
- spam solves to get comfortable with 3s
- took me around 2-3 days for each 3s

Get faster:
- improve memo
- improve fingertricks
